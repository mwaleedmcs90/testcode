# The things that need to be changed:

1- We should use Laravel Requests to apply validations and rules for the form and HTTP requests.

2- We should use Repository and Repository Interfaces with Models.

3- We should use Laravel Helpers instead of directly using PHP functions like arrays and file functions.

4- Should be used proper API documentation code and responses file for APIs.

5- Should be used constants variables that can be set from the .env file instead of directly passed static values in the variables.

6- Should be used Models function in the queries instead of DB:: queries.

7- Should be used Laravel resources for API responses.

8- Should be removed unused included files.

9- Should be removed unused commented code.

10- Should be used DB transactions if there are multiple insertion/update operations.

11- Should be used Laravel Queues for email sending id there are multiple or large emails.

12- Take for code formatting that should be the same throughout the project if we use snake casing for variables then it should be the same in all projects.
